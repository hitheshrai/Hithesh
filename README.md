## About Me
I am Hithesh Rai Purushothama, a senior at Arizona State University majoring in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, with a passion for renewable energy, AI, and innovative material research. My experience spans internships and research roles at esteemed organizations like Purdue University, Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin, and Arizona State University’s **Next Lab**. Through these, I’ve developed skills in photovoltaic technology, offline AI-driven edge devices, and material research for sustainable technologies.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design
- **3D Visualizations**: Three.js for interactive atom simulations
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages

## Project Highlights
Below are some key projects featured in this portfolio:

1. **Sol AI - Solar-Based Offline AI System**
   - Developed in collaboration with Next Lab, Sol AI is an offline AI-driven edge device powered by solar energy. The device was designed to perform AI computations in remote areas without access to conventional power sources or connectivity, showcasing the potential of sustainable, solar-based technology for AI applications.

2. **Zoom Project - Next Lab**
   - Led the development of a Zoom integration project at Next Lab, focusing on secure and efficient video streaming capabilities with real-time analytics integration. This project emphasized scalability, data security, and innovative UI/UX features to enhance the remote communication experience.

3. **Synthesis and Characterization of Halide Perovskite for Solar Cells**
   - Conducted Intel-funded research at ASU, focusing on the synthesis and optical/electrical characterization of perovskite thin films. This project contributed to advancements in perovskite materials for photovoltaic applications.

4. **Probing Structural Instability in Quantum Materials**
   - Collaborated with Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin on material analysis using X-ray and neutron diffraction to study phase transitions in ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials.

5. **2Unify Education Program**
   - Led a curriculum development initiative in collaboration with Bridge2Africa, creating a Python-based robotics curriculum for middle school students, aimed at expanding STEM education and skills.
